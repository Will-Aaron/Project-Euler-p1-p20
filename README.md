# Project-Euler-p1-p20
This repository contains my Project Euler Coding Challenge Solutions for Problems 1 through 20
Project Euler is a online forum containing a list of mathematical challenges intended to be solved through the use of functional programming. The website containing released and archived problems can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/. While the first 100 problems are considered free for discussion. Project Euler problems are intended to be mathematical challenges to teach the user, and so therefore sharing solutions is discouraged. I am posting my own solutions for the sake of a portfolio piece, but I encourage you to attempt theproblems yourself.
